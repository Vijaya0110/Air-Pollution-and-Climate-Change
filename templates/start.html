<h2>Have you ever wondered what is in the air we breathe? Learn this and what impacts the Earth’s air quality.</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is Air Quality?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>When air quality is good, the air is clear and contains only small amounts of solid particle and chemical pollutants. Poor air quality, which contains high levels of pollutants, is often hazy and dangerous to health and the environment. Air quality is described according to the Air Quality Index (AQI), which is based on the concentration of pollutants present in the air at a particular location.</p>
  <p/>
  <b>Why Does Air Quality Change?</b>
  <p>Because air is always moving, air quality can change from day to day, or even from one hour to the next. For a specific location, the air quality is a direct result of both how air moves through the area and how people are influencing the air. </p>
  <b>Humans Affect Air Quality</b>
<p>Geographic features such as mountain ranges, coastlines, and land use can cause air pollutants to concentrate in or disperse from an area. However, the types and amounts of pollutants entering the air have a much larger impact on air quality. Natural sources, such as volcanic activity or dust storms, add some pollutants to the air, but most pollutants come from human activity. Vehicle exhaust, smoke from coal power plants, and toxic gases from industry are examples of human-made air pollutants.</p>

  <b>Winds Affect Air Quality</b>
<p>Wind patterns have an impact on air quality because winds move air pollution around. For example, a coastal area with an inland mountain range may have more air pollution during the day when sea breezes push pollutants over land and lower air pollution in the evenings because the direction of the breeze reverses. Land breezes in the evenings push air pollution out over the ocean.</p>

  <b>Temperature Affects Air Quality</b>
<p>Temperature can also affect air quality. In urban areas, air quality is often worse in the winter months. When the air temperature is cooler, exhaust pollutants can be trapped close to the surface beneath a layer of dense, cold air. In summer months, heated air rises and disperses pollutants from the Earth’s surface through the upper troposphere, and increased sunlight results in more harmful ground-level ozone.</p>
  </div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How We're Changing the Air</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Air pollution is created when harmful substances, in the form of gases, liquids, or solids, enter the air. There are natural processes that create air pollution - such as sulfur and chlorine gases from volcanic activity, smoke and ash from wildfires, dust storms, and biological decay - but most pollution enters the air from human-made (anthropogenic) sources.

Most human-made air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and industry. Common pollutants produced by fossil fuel burning engines are carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulates. Stoves, incinerators, and open burning produce carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, as well as particulates.

We also create chemicals that would not naturally occur in the atmosphere. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are used as refrigerants, are examples of pollutants that only come from human activity. Other sources of CFCs include fumes from aerosol sprays, paint, varnish, and solvents.</p>
  <b> Six Types of Human-Made Air Pollutants </b>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI) is based on the measurements of six pollutants: particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), lead (Pb), and carbon monoxide (CO).</p>

  <b>Particulate Matter (PM)</b>
<p> An image comparing size of particulate matter to other small objects. The largest object is a human hair (which is between 50-70 microns in diameter), then a grain of fine beach sand (which is about 90 microns in diameter). On the hair is shown an example of particulate matter that is less than 10 microns in diameter, such as dust, pollen, or mold. And on the the dust, pollen, or mold is shown an example of particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter (combustion particles or VOCs).
How small is 2.5 micrometers? The average human hair is between 50-70 micrometers. Fine particulate matter is so tiny that it enters the lungs and even the bloodstream.

Particulate matter, also called aerosols or particle pollution, is composed of a large variety of chemicals. Some particles are primary pollutants that come directly from smokestacks, construction sites, fires, or volcanoes. However, most are secondary pollutants that form as the result of chemical reactions in the atmosphere due to emissions from power plants, factories, and vehicles.

<ul>Particulate matter is classified by size:

<li> PM10 is coarse particles with a diameter of 2.5 to 10 micrometers, such as dust, dirt, pollen, or mold.</li>
<li> PM2.5  is fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, such as soot, smoke, organic compounds, or metals.</li>
  </ul> </p>
      <b>Nitrogen Dioxide </b>

<p>Vehicle exhaust is the largest source of nitrogen dioxide pollution in the atmosphere, but it is also formed by factories and power plants, and naturally by lightning strikes, volcanoes, and during the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrogen dioxide causes the characteristic reddish-brown color of smog and reacts in the presence of sunlight to produce harmful ozone.</p>


      <b>Ozone (O3)</b>
<p> Though ozone naturally exists within the stratosphere, it does not typically occur at the surface. Ozone in the troposphere is a secondary air pollutant created from chemical reactions with other air pollutants. It forms when nitrogen oxides from tailpipes and smokestacks react with VOCs in the presence of sunlight. Tropospheric ozone, also called ground-level ozone, is most common in urban areas and is often measured at high levels in the summer and during the warmest times of the day.

One common type of secondary pollution that contains ozone is smog. Smog is a smelly, toxic haze composed of ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and a variety of other chemicals. Smog is an example of how primary air pollution from human activity can lead to even more harmful secondary pollution.</p>

      <b>Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</b>
<p> The smell associated with burnt matches comes from sulfur dioxide. Almost all sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is the result of human activity, though volcanoes are also a natural source.  Coal, oil, and gas often contain sulfur, as do some mineral ores. The burning of any of these sulfur-containing materials, during industrial processing or generation of electricity, releases toxic sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, together called sulfur oxides, into the atmosphere. When mixed with water droplets suspended in the air, sulfur dioxide forms sulfuric acid, which is a component of acid rain.</p>

      <b> Lead (Pb)</b>
      </p>Lead is a heavy metal found naturally underground. It enters the air through ore and metals processing, and through the burning of leaded fuel for aircraft and vehicles. The EPA’s requirement to remove lead from “on-road” vehicle gasoline resulted in a 98% decrease in lead levels in the air between 1980 and 2014 (leaded fuels are still allowed for race cars, farm equipment, and propellor aircraft).</p>

  <b>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</b>
<p>If something is burning, carbon monoxide is likely being released. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is created when carbon is burned. Most of the carbon monoxide pollution comes from burning fossil fuels in vehicles, factories, and power plants, but another major source is from burning wood or crop waste. Carbon monoxide is released from volcanoes and forest fires as well. Secondary pollutants like ozone and carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, come from carbon monoxide.</p>

  <b>Greenhouse Gas Pollution  </b>
<p>The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is increasing the amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) in our atmosphere. Small amounts of these gases in the atmosphere are safe to breathe but are also dangerous because they are changing Earth’s climate through a process called the greenhouse effect. Land use changes due to farming and forestry also lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. For example, livestock and their waste release methane, and cutting down trees mean less carbon dioxide is removed from the air. The shift from coal to natural gas as an energy source and the increased use of renewable energy is helping to slow carbon dioxide emissions, but overall greenhouse gas emissions remain high. As long as greenhouse gas emissions remain high, global average temperatures will continue to rise.</p>
